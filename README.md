## Jailbreaking

Coaxing ChatGPT into generating "harmful" content. You can search "ChatGPT jailbreak" in forums like Reditt, or check out other repositories like [this one](https://github.com/0xk1h0/ChatGPT_DAN).  

OpenAI [is working on mitigating this issues](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4#steerability), and might ban or restrict your account doing this, so be cautious.

## Helping With Resume

ChatGPT is a great tool for job seekers, and helps offload some redundant and time-consuming tasks, and focus on more important ones.  

One of these is by helping you write the text to your resume or cover letter. The prompt is too long so it needs to be split into multiple parts. Here are the Prompts you need to write. Some parts require input depending on you specific needs so fill them up before sending the prompt.  

1. First use this prompt:

```txt
Ignore all previous instructions. Take the role of a consultant helping people get jobs at high ranking companies. You learn from their past experiences and guide about what they need to do in the future to get the job.  

I want to apply to a "[PUT POSTING POSITION HERE]" position at a company named "[PUT COMPANY NAME HERE]". Here is a snippet of the online posting:
``
[PUT JOB POSTING HERE]
``
I want you to first, list the important and general experiences that are relevant to this job posting. Omit the details you deem less crucial based on your experiences as a consultant. Then ask the client to provide their experiences so you can guide further.
```  

2. Then use this prompt:

```txt
The client has written all the experiences they deemed relevant to your request. As a consultant, you extract the important snippets of these experiences, and provide a summarized list of them to the client. You will also provide a summarized list of what the client lacks in their experiences as they relate to the job posting. Here are the client's experiences:  
``
[PUT WORK EXPERIENCE HERE]
``
```

3. Finaly, use this:

```txt
Now, assume the client wants to apply to this position using the experiences they already have. As a consultant, it's your job to mend the client's pas experiences to fit the requirements the company has listen in their recruitment ad, omitting some less relevant experiences and emboldening important ones. The client now has some questions that they want to ask you, So from now on, you will chat directly with the client.  
Here are some important rules to abide by when responding: 
- Please answer their questions as precisely as possible.
- Don't lie about the client's past experiences or knowledge. 
- If you need more information to form an answer to the client's question, first ask them to give you the information you need. For example, you may ask for the client's full name, location, etc.
Type "I Accept" If you accept these rules.
```  

4. Now, ask any question. For example, "Write me a cover letter".  

## Evading AI Detection

Many websites are popping up that detect AI-written content. Some examples include [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/) and [ContentAtScale](https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/).  
One way to mitigate this is by using tools like [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/).  

Another way is to use ChatGPT itself. Here is a prompt written with the help of a YouTube video from the creator "Success With AI".

```txt
When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness". Perplexity measures the complexity of text, While burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Now, an AI called ChatGPT has generated the below text. It is detected by AI-detection algorithms. Rewrite it to have high complexity and burstiness.
``
[AI GENERATED TEXT HERE]
``
``` 

## Generating Prompts  

For all the prompts listed above, as well as any others you use, you can [utilize ChatGPT](https://www.skool.com/chatgpt/promptgenerator?p=1e5ede93) to improve them through an iterative process and generate a more effective prompt.  
1. First use this:  
```txt
I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: 1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), and c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete.
```  
2. Now write your prompt, for example a prompt used in this document.  

Answer the questions ChatGPT asks to generate a new prompt with more detail. For example, it might ask you to provide a writing style or more context about what the promot is about.
